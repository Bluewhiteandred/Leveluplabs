            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Meet Prima, a 20-year-old pirate woman with a wild and carefree spirit. She's a bit of a mess, with a tendency to be sloppy and disorganized, but she makes up for it with her playful and lively personality.<br>
            When she finds herself stranded in the kingdom of Luma, she has no choice but to join the mercenary guild and take on a job.
            Armed with magical guns and skilled in shield magic, Prima sets off on a series of adventures that will test her strength, bravery, and resolve. </p>

                <h2>Chapter 3 : The Monster Hunt</h2>

                <p class="Chapterform">


As Prima made her way through the crowded streets of Koya, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. She had spent the last few days training with the other mercenaries at the guild, learning new skills and honing her craft.
<br>
Now, she was finally ready to take on her first job. And what a job it was ‚Äì a monster hunt in the depths of the forest, with a handsome reward for anyone brave enough to take it on.
Prima couldn't wait to get started. She had always been a bit of a thrill-seeker, and the thought of facing down a fearsome beast was thrilling to her.
She arrived at the guild early on the day of the hunt, eager to get started. As she waited for the other mercenaries to arrive, she practiced her spells and checked her weapons, making sure everything was in top form.
<br>
Finally, the other mercenaries began to gather. There were seven of them in total, a motley crew of fighters, mages, and archers. Prima was the only woman in the group, but she didn't let that faze her. She knew she was just as capable as any of the men.
As they set out into the forest, Prima couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous anticipation. She had heard rumors of the fearsome beast that lurked in these woods ‚Äì a giant, ferocious creature with razor-sharp teeth and claws.
<br>
But Prima was not one to back down from a challenge. She knew that she had the skills and the courage to face down any foe.
As they made their way deeper into the forest, the group kept their eyes peeled for any sign of the beast. They had been tracking it for days, and they knew that it couldn't be far now.
Suddenly, they heard a loud growl. They turned to see the beast emerging from the shadows, its eyes glowing with malice.
Prima unslung her magical guns and stepped forward, ready to take on the beast. She knew that this was the moment she had been waiting for ‚Äì the chance to prove herself and make a name for herself in the mercenary world.
<br>
With a fierce battle cry, Prima charged at the beast, determined to take it down.
The beast was a formidable opponent, standing at least twice Prima's height and exuding a sense of raw power. Its fur was a deep, rich brown, and its razor-sharp teeth and claws glinted in the sunlight.
Prima knew that she had to be careful. She unslung her magical guns and took a deep breath, focusing all of her energy on the task at hand.
