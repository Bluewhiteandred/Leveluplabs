            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Meet Prima, a 20-year-old pirate woman with a wild and carefree spirit. She's a bit of a mess, with a tendency to be sloppy and disorganized, but she makes up for it with her playful and lively personality.<br>
            When she finds herself stranded in the kingdom of Luma, she has no choice but to join the mercenary guild and take on a job.
            Armed with magical guns and skilled in shield magic, Prima sets off on a series of adventures that will test her strength, bravery, and resolve. </p>

The other mercenaries sprang into action, launching a coordinated attack on the beast. An archer unslung his bow and nocked an arrow, taking aim at the beast. He let loose a flurry of arrows, each one finding its mark and sinking deep into the beast's flesh.
<br>
Meanwhile, the mage focused his energy and began casting a series of powerful spells. He summoned a bolt of lightning that struck the beast, causing it to let out a roar of pain. He followed up with a burst of flame, engulfing the beast in a searing inferno.
<br>
The beast let out a roar of pain and swung its tail at Prima, narrowly missing her. She dodged the attack and fired off another shot, this time hitting the beast in the leg.
The beast staggered, its movements growing sluggish. Prima knew that this was her chance. She focused all of her energy on her shield magic, conjuring a powerful force field around her.
The beast lunged at her again, but this time its attack was deflected by the force field. Prima took the opportunity to strike again, firing off a series of shots that hit the beast square in the chest.
The beast let out a final roar of pain and collapsed to the ground, defeated. <br>
Prima let out a triumphant cheer and approached the beast, making sure it was truly dead.
As she stood over the beast, panting and sweat dripping from her brow, Prima couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had faced down her fears and emerged victorious, and she knew that she was capable of anything.
But the fight had taken its toll on her. She was battered and bruised, and her magical energy was depleted. She knew that she needed to rest and recover before she could tackle her next challenge.
She turned to the other mercenaries, who were looking at her with a mixture of awe and respect. "Well, that was quite a fight," she said with a smile. "I think we deserve a round of drinks to celebrate."
<br>
The fight was long and grueling, but in the end, Prima emerged victorious. She had proven herself to be a true warrior, and she knew that this was just the beginning of her journey.
As she stood victorious, Prima couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had faced down her fears and emerged victorious, and she knew that she was capable of anything.
With a smile on her face and a song in her heart, Prima set off into the unknown, ready to take on whatever the world had in store for her.
