            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Meet Prima, a 20-year-old pirate woman with a wild and carefree spirit. She's a bit of a mess, with a tendency to be sloppy and disorganized, but she makes up for it with her playful and lively personality.<br>
            When she finds herself stranded in the kingdom of Luma, she has no choice but to join the mercenary guild and take on a job.
            Armed with magical guns and skilled in shield magic, Prima sets off on a series of adventures that will test her strength, bravery, and resolve. </p>

                <h2>Chapter 2 : The city of koya</h2>

                <p class="Chapterform">

As Prima approached the city gates, she was greeted by a group of armed guards.
"Halt! Who goes there?" one of them called out, eyeing her suspiciously.
Prima held up her hands in surrender, trying to appear as nonthreatening as possible. "I'm just a poor sailor who got shipwrecked on the shore," she said, flashing her most charming smile. "I was hoping to find some work in the city and maybe a place to rest my head."
<br>
The guards looked at each other skeptically, but eventually they let her pass. Prima breathed a sigh of relief, grateful for the chance to start over.
As she made her way through the crowded streets of the city, Prima was struck by the bustling energy of the place. Everywhere she looked, there were merchants selling their wares, fishermen unloading their catch, and people of all shapes and sizes going about their business.
<br>
She made her way to the market square, hoping to find some work or at least a warm meal. But as she scanned the crowd, she realized that she was in for a tough time.
Without a ship or any other means of earning a living, Prima was running low on funds. She knew she had to find a way to make ends meet, or else she would be back on the streets.
Just as she was starting to despair, Prima heard a commotion on the other side of the square. She turned to see a group of people gathered around a large, imposing building.
"What's going on over there?" she asked a passing merchant.
<br>
"That's the mercenary guild," the merchant replied. "People go there to take on all sorts of jobs ‚Äì monster hunting, resource protection, bodyguard work, you name it."
Prima's ears perked up at the mention of monster hunting. She had always been a skilled fighter, with magical guns and mastery of shield magic at her disposal. Maybe this was the opportunity she had been looking for.
<br>
Without hesitation, Prima made her way to the guild. As she entered the enormous building and saw the endless stream of people coming and going, she knew that she was on the right path. She was determined to make the most of this chance and start a new chapter in her life.
With a fire in her heart and a song on her lips, Prima set off to conquer the world and live life to the fullest...
