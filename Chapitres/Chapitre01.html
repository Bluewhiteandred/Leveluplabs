            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Meet Prima, a 20-year-old pirate woman with a wild and carefree spirit. She's a bit of a mess, with a tendency to be sloppy and disorganized, but she makes up for it with her playful and lively personality.<br>
            When she finds herself stranded in the kingdom of Luma, she has no choice but to join the mercenary guild and take on a job.
            Armed with magical guns and skilled in shield magic, Prima sets off on a series of adventures that will test her strength, bravery, and resolve. </p>
             <div class="container">
            <h1>Echoes of Freedom: The Adventures of Prima</h1>
            <div class="chapter-list">
                <h2>Chapter 1 : A New Beginning</h2>

<p class="Chapterform"> Prima stood on the shore, her soaked clothes clinging to her body and her wild hair whipping in the wind. She looked out at the vast ocean that stretched before her, the setting sun casting a warm glow over the raging waves.
The roar of the waves as they crashed against the rocky shore smashed the broken pieces of the ship into oblivion, reducing them to splinters with each violent blow. The frothy foam that spewed forth with each crash was like the drool of a wild beast, foretelling the destruction that was to come.
In that very moment, Prima's eyes shone with a malevolent shine, reflecting the broken state of both the ship and her spirit.
"Well, that didn't go according to the plan" she muttered to herself, shaking her head in disbelief.
Just a few hours ago, Prima had been sailing the high seas on her beloved ship, the Scarlet Siren. But the sudden storm had struck, capsizing the vessel and leaving Prima stranded on this unknown shore.
She had always been a bit of a daydreamer, and her head was filled with tales of adventure and romance. But she had never imagined that she would find herself in such a predicament with no idea where she was or how she was going to get home. All she knew was that she had to find a way to survive.
Prima trudged through the sand, her body a red canvas of lacerations. The saltwater stung her wounds as she dragged her sore legs like two heavy stone. Her clothes were torn and tattered, revealing her skin goosebumped and shivering from the cold.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 1-2 : A new friend</h3>
<p class="Chapterform">
Prima had just stepped off the rack and onto the shore, her mind focused on the task at hand. She had a lot on her plate, and she didn't have time to waste.
As she walked down the beach, a cute little kitsune rushed into her feet, causing her to stumble. The kitsune was about the size of a small cat, with a fluffy tail and pointy ears. Its fur was a beautiful shade of golden orange, and its eyes sparkled with mischief.
Prima looked down at the kitsune, a feeling of annoyance washing over her. She shout at the creature and tell it to get out of her way. She had no time for this kind of nonsense, and she was determined to get rid of the nuisance as quickly as possible.
The kitsune didn't seem to get the message, looked up at her with wide, pleading eyes. It seemed to be begging for something, but Prima couldn't quite figure out what. She shook her head and waved her hands at the kitsune, trying to shoo it away.
Prima knew that she must look foolish, trying to communicate with a creature that couldn't understand her.
Just as she was about to give up and walk away, a huge monster's cry resounded through the air. Prima felt a surge of panic and fear wash over her. She had faced down her fair share of monsters in the past, but this one sounded particularly fierce.
The kitsune, sensing her fear, rushed into her clothes and almost passed out of fear.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1-3 : glimmer of light</h3>

<p class="Chapterform">
Just as she was starting to lose hope, Prima spotted a glimmer of light in the distance. She quickened her pace, her heart racing with excitement. As she drew closer, she saw that the light was coming from a bustling port city.
"Well, this looks like as good a place as any to start anew," she muttered to herself, a sly smile spreading across her face.
And with that, Prima set off towards the city, ready to take on whatever the world had in store for her.
